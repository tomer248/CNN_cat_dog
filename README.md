This is one of many projects I did during my Udemy course :
Machine Learning A-Z: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science -Kirill Eremenko
In this task I had to get the machine to differentiate between a dog and a cat.
https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/ - this is the course and all the data is inside this course. 
If you are getting trouble in doing this assignment I got pretty good results and you can feel free to learn from my code
